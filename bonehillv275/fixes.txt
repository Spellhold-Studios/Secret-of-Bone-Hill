1) AREAS (BGT side, could it be simply replicated for TuTu too?). (Almost, songlist is different, SBB).

 Songlist updated for BGT v1.00 (only BGT part); (Note: Tutu songs reset to previous songlist, SBB)


 BH0100.ARE, .WED, .TIS, SR.BMP -
   door/travelling regions fixed. It was possible to enter some doors without actual opening them;
   tileset updated once again (doors/shadows cleaned up);
   search map updated (fixes for all doors - it was hard sometimes to reach travel regions), some solid
   obstacles (code 0) replaced by soft obstacles (code 8);
   TP2 patching changed (strrefs' offsets).

 BH0200.ARE, .WED, .TIS, SR.BMP -
   door/travelling regions fixed. It was possible to enter some doors without actual opening them;
   tileset updated once again (shadows - there's an original tileset that I redrawn a year ago :P, so it's
   included again);  (Should have been in here all this time, SBB)
   search map updated (fixes for all doors - it was hard sometimes to reach travel regions), some solid
   obstacles (code 0) replaced by soft obstacles (code 8);
   TP2 patching changed (strrefs' offsets).

(*** A TIP ***)
(*** A travel region must lie inside boundaries of door's region to be hidden before a door becomes open ***)
(*************)

 BH0300.ARE, .WED, SR.BMP -

   wallgroups were completely rebuilt;
   TP2 patching changed (strrefs' offsets).


 BH0500.ARE, .WED, SR.BMP -
   search map updated (fixes for all doors - it was hard sometimes to reach travel regions), buggy "holes" at the very eastern
   part of walls (that made possible to walk outside) closed;
   several wallgroups fixed.

 BH0700.WED -
   several wallgroups fixed.

 BH1101.WED, SR.BMP -

   wallgroups created (WED was empty).



ONCE AGAIN - Only BGT resources updated. I'm not very sure if they can be just replicated for TuTu resources.
If so, SBB, plz do it... :D

(Done, SBB)

           numeric value for Shout() changed to ID (ALERT = 125).

         simple Polymorph(MAGE_MALE_HUMAN).

(Note: Reset all Shout(ALERT) commands back to Shout(125) because Tutu doesn't understand it and gives you error
messages on install.  However, the scripts work fine.  Go figure. SBB

3) There were some missing creatures:
    HOBG02.CRE - referenced from BH1000, BH1002.BCS
