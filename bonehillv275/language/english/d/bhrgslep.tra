@1    = ~No sleeping in the city streets! If you tire you must either find an inn or go outside the city boundaries!~
@2    = ~Move along vagrants! Find an inn like respectable citizens, or camp outside the city limits! ~
@3    = ~I'll not have vagrants stinkin' up the streets on MY watch! Get to an inn or sleep outside the city. Either way I want you gone!~
