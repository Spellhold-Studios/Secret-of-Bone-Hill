@1   = ~All praise Amunator!  What do you wish, child?~
@2   = ~Why is a holy statue in this unholy place?~
@3   = ~This place was not always such.  Many years ago this keep was used to protect the isle.  Unfortunately, evil finally won.  Since then several different forces have taken over the keep.  Evil begats evil and each time more sinister creatures control the keep.~
@4   = ~Do you know anything about the current environment?  Why all the undead?~
@5   = ~That child I cannot help you with.  You are the first to talk to me in many years.  I have no idea what has taken place here recently.  I know that evil has lived here for many years.  Its form is not known to me.  The last worshiper to talk to me was a wizard looking to stop the plague of undead.  I have not heard from him and can only assume he lost.~
@6   = ~This area is peaceful for now, thanks to you.  Perhaps it may stay that way for awhile.~
@7   = ~You dare to touch me!~
@8   = ~I sense a change.  You have cleansed the evil from this place?  I thank you.  I look forward to the day when Amanator's followers return.~
@9   = ~The evil is still here.  Perhaps you could remove it?~
