@0    = ~Well, well.  What do we have here?  A band of weary travelers.  And what brings you to our lovely home?~
@1    = ~We are looking for a group of bandits in this area.  Have you seen them?~
@2    = ~Your home?~
@3    = ~Yes, we live here near Bald Hill.  Oh, the ground isn't great for farming but local travelers help provide us with what we need.~
@4    = ~Yes, you have mentioned "us" several times now.  I assume the orcs hiding around us are part this "us"?~
@5    = ~Yes!  It is good that you can see them.  I always think that people should see their killers before they die.  Attack men!~
@6    = ~Bandits?  No.  We prefer to call ourselves "liberators of the wealthy" and you look like you have what we want to liberate.  Attack!~
